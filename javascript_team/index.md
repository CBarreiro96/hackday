## How to play 
### Element in the game
### Instruccion
The game can be played for player-machine or two player.


#### Two Player
1. The two players decide in advance how many games they will play, which must be an even number
2. One player becomes the codemaker, the other the codebreaker
3. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs. These group of color can be repeated or diferent.
4. The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within eight turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board.
5. Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback placing a colored or black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position, but if the key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position, the color will be white.
